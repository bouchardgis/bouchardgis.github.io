### SEEP Web App - Solar Energy Estimations & Projections
[![alt text](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/SEEP_SolarEnergyEstimationsAndProjections_Screencap.PNG "SEEP Web App")](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/SEEP_SolarEnergyEstimationsAndProjections_Screencap.PNG)

The goal of this project was to create a process driven solar energy estimation web app for the City of Airdrie. This was a pilot project to show how a process-driven tool for solar energy estimation could be scaled up to other locales. 

The web app was created from LiDAR and census data for the City of Airdrie, all of the data open source catalog and is available to download by the general public. ESRI’s ArcGIS Solar radiation tools were used to produce estimated solar insolation on the rooftops of buildings in the city for a full calendar year (simulated). Further calculations were done based on NREL's (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) research for the cost of solar energy generation - these results were added as tabular data for each building in the city. The results of this project are a working web app for the City of Airdrie that will give users key solar information for a given address.

## Maps <a name="maps"></a>
### Natural Regions of Alberta
[![alt text](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/Alberta_NaturalRegionsMap.PNG   "Natural Regions of Alberta")](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/Alberta_NaturalRegionsMap.PNG)
The natural regions and subregions of Alberta, Canada vary widely - from dry and hot badlands to vast unbroken forests. This map was made to help visualize the different regions of the province. Created in ArcGIS with the use of shapefiles (for the regions and subregions) and digital elevation models. 

### Crane Glacier Surfaces
[![alt text](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/CraneGlacier_SurfaceGeneration.PNG  "Crane Glacier - Surfaces")](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/CraneGlacier_SurfaceGeneration.PNG)

The Crane Glacier, in Antarctica, has been undergoing dramatic changes in recent decades due to a changing climate. These changes can be studied in greater detail with the help of surface visualizations. This map includes a compilation of surfaces generated using ArcGIS: a digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect, hillshade, viewshed sample, and solar insolation.

For more details, please read the [Crane Glacier Surfaces Generation Report (PDF)](https://bouchardgis.github.io/reports/CraneGlacierStudy_SurfaceGenerationReport.pdf).

### Waiparous Image Classication

The Western Sky Land Trust (WSLT) is striving to conserve open and natural areas within the Calgary region, focusing on watershed lands associated to agricultural, natural, heritage, scenic, and recreational values (WSLT, 2015). They have approached our team to help them to produce a sampling strategy for a species inventory program on a land parcel near Waiparous, AB – including vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic species.

### SEEP - Development Reports
[![alt text](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/SEEP_Reports_Covers.PNG "SEEP - Solar Energy Estimations and Projects - Reports")](https://bouchardgis.github.io/images/SEEP_Reports_Covers.PNG)

The creation of the SEEP Web App took around 4 months - the following reports go through the planning and documentation of the project prior to release, and should be detailed enough to recreate the project, as needed. Reports include: Proposal, Project Plan, Data Needs Assessment, Project Update and Final Poster.

#### SEEP Capstone Proposal
This document covers the details of the project proposal, as follows: the rationale, deliverables & scope, required software, data sources, data management structure, data security, database model, metadata maintenance, data handling & GIS processes, final scale & industry standards, and the team members.

Link: [SEEP - Capstone Proposal (PDF)](https://bouchardgis.github.io/reports/SEEP_1_CapstoneProposal_DiscoverYourPotential.pdf)

#### SEEP Project Plan
This document covers the steps involved in planning this project; the technical approach. Included in the document: project scope, assumptions & constraints, task descriptions, roles & responsibilities, schedule, risk management plan, performance measurement & quality management, and deliverables. 

Link: [SEEP - Project Plan (PDF)](https://bouchardgis.github.io/reports/SEEP_2_DiscoverYourPotential_ProjectPlan.pdf)

#### SEEP Data Needs Assessment
This document was produced around a third of the way through the project - ensuring all data required was gathered by that point, and helped to determine what data might have been missing using a gap analysis. 

Link: [SEEP - Data Needs Assessment (PDF)](https://bouchardgis.github.io/reports/SEEP_3_DataNeedsAssessment.pdf)

#### SEEP Project Update
This document covers the updated specifications of the project: from team members to methodology. 

Link: [SEEP - Project Update (PDF)](https://bouchardgis.github.io/reports/SEEP_4_SolarEnergyEstimationsAndProjections_ProjectUpdate.pdf)

#### SEEP Final Poster
This poster was created to showcase the project before its final presentation - printed using a plotter and ArcMap. The PDF version was recreated using archived data and geodatabases, and produced using ArcGIS Pro.

The SEEP Web App needed a lot of pre-processing to be a smooth and optimized experience for users on the web. As a result, a few scripts were required to automate the process. To view the scripts, go to [bouchardgis.github.io/scripts](https://bouchardgis.github.io/scripts)
