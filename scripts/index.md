## Script Samples
### Zion National Park - Python-Generated Map
The two scripts are used to create a map document where input features are buffered to show an impact zone around the input features of Zion National Park. Once done, a PDF of the map is automatically exported. 

#### Part A
This script takes input features that may be impacted by impacting features (input), and outputs a feature class including the input features that would be impacted within a buffer of the impacting features.

#### Part B
This script is for Part B: Adds the provided datasets, and outputs from Part A to an already-created map document (MXD file). The map, once saved programmatically, is then exported to a PDF of the same name.
